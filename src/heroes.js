    "Luke begins his story in the Ordinary World of moisture farming on the desert planet Tatooine. We learn that most of Luke's friends have already left the planet to join the Imprial Academy, and he yearns for a life of adventure and not the safe, uneventful one his Uncle Owen has planned.",

    "Luke's hears the call to adventure comes when he finds a message stored in R2-D2. Princess Leia's message, 'Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope,' invite Luke to leave behind his modest and uneventful life of moisture farming and join the Rebellion against the Empire. We see he is drawn by promise of escape from his Ordinary World.",

    "Initially, Luke refuses the call to join the rebellion and save Princess Leia. R2-D2 runs away to find Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Luke chases him so he won't be in trouble with his Uncle. After finding Ben Kenobi, Luke still refuses the call to adventure, claiming  'It's all such a long way from here.' At the end of this step, Luke returns home to discover his Uncle and Aunt murdered and their farm a smoldering ruin.",

    "Though Luke has already met Obi-Wan Kenobi, after a run-in with Sand People Obi-Wan explains the Jedi, the Force, and about Luke's father. When he  offers to teach Luke the ways of the Jedi, Luke again refuses the call to adventure. After discovering the Empire murdered his Aunt & Uncle, Luke returns to Obi-Wan and says, 'There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.' Luke accepts Obi-Wan the mentor who will guide him on the next stage on his journey.",

    "Luke follows Obi-Wan and crosses the, in this case literal, threshold of his journey in the form of the Mos Eisley spaceport. The spaceport is a new world for Luke. Luke is out of his element and quickly realizes there is much he doesn't know, but Obi-Wan's guidance and protecting and Luke's commitment to the journey see them through.",

    "Luke gathers more allies, Han Solo and Chewbacca. Neither are anything like what Luke has experienced before and his perceptions of the road ahead are given new perspectives. When the group attempt to leave Tatooine, stormtroopers arrive to attack them. With the help of his new allies, Luke succeeds in escaping the planet with the droids. Throughout we see that all the other characters with him are more experienced and that Luke realizes he has a lot to learn",

    "On the way to Alderaan Obi-Wan begins teaching Luke about the Force and how to wield a lightsaber. When they arrive at Alderaan they discover the planet has been destroyed and replaced by the Death Star which represents the Inmost Cave, a place of danger and conflict and trial. Fear and doubt return to Luke in the face of such an overwhelming obstacle. 'I have a bad feeling about this.'",

    "After being captured Obi-Wan leaves to ensure they are able to leave and Luke begins his ordeal. 'The Ordeal' is a test that the hero must overcome, usually by drawing on new skills to defeat an enemy. Luke is also forced to rise to the challenge to match the capabilities of Han and Chewbacca and we see him becoming a leader to their group. Under Luke's guidance they rescue of Leia and escape to their ship. However, success is not without loss as Luke watches his mentor perish at Darth Vader's hands.",

    "Luke emerges from his ordeal a worldlier, more adult hero. His reward isn't a sword like in traditional myths, but instead a place in the Rebellion as a pilot and the respect of his allies and peers, just like he wished back on Tatooine. Luke is now ready for the last part of his journey.",

    "The hero typically begins his journey back to the ordinary world from the beginning. Luke is on this path too, but his ordinary world is one without the Empire, not the physical home he left behind. Luke's 'Road back' requires that he join the attack to destroy the Death Star. At this stage, Luke must also choose between his needs and the greater good of the rebellion. When Luke turns down Han's offer to leave, he chooses the greater good.",

    "The climactic final battle. The consequences have never been higher: if Luke fails, the Rebels will be destroyed and the Empire will rule unchallenged. Luke and his newfound Rebel companions are vastly outnumbered and several pilots die during the attack. Luke's childhood friend, Biggs, as well as the leader of the attack are killed testing Luke's resolve. Ultimately, Luke succeeds in destroying the Death Star thanks to the return Han Solo and by trusting the force. While Luke's rebirth isn't phsyical, we see him undergo a change by putting his trust in the Force and in himself. He takes his first steps toward becoming a Jedi.",

    "The Elixer represents a prize or treasure the hero has earned by surviving the climax of their story. While Luke doesn't bring back gold or weapons or anything like that, his return signifies that his friends and the Rebels will survive to fight another day. The treasure is hope and knowledge that the Empire can be defeated. The elixir also represents the success of the journey, and we see Luke's success when he is presented the medal by Princess Leia. Luke wanted to leave the farm, join the larger universe, and make a difference that mattered. At the end of his journey we can see that he has"
